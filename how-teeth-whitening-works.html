                    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teeth whitening works by breaking down stains through oxidation.</li>
                        <li>Professional whitening is safer and more effective than DIY methods.</li>
                        <li>Not all stains can be removed; some need alternative cosmetic treatments.</li>
                        <li>Results vary based on your enamel, habits, and the method used.</li>
                        <li>Professional supervision reduces the risk of enamel damage and tooth sensitivity.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Teeth whitening involves chemical reactions that target and lift stains from both the outer
                            and inner surfaces of the teeth. Hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide is typically used,
                            which releases oxygen molecules to break down pigmented compounds. This process lightens the
                            appearance of teeth without physically removing any enamel.</p>
                        <h2>How Whitening Teeth Works</h2>
                        <p>Whitening teeth relies on the power of oxidation. When whitening agents like hydrogen
                            peroxide come into contact with your teeth, they break apart chemical bonds in stain-causing
                            molecules. This makes the molecules less visible, giving your teeth a whiter appearance.</p>
                        <p>There are two types of stains:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Extrinsic stains: Surface stains caused by coffee, tea, red wine, or tobacco.</li>
                            <li>Intrinsic stains: Deeper discoloration within the tooth, often due to aging, trauma, or
                                medication.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Professional treatments can effectively address both types, while most over-the-counter
                            options struggle with intrinsic stains.</p>

                    <div class="text-content">
                        <h2>Why Professional Whitening Matters</h2>
                        <p>While at-home kits and DIY hacks promise quick results, they rarely match the effectiveness
                            of a professional approach. Overuse of whitening strips or abrasive pastes can wear down
                            enamel and increase sensitivity.</p>
                        <p>In a clinical setting, concentrations of whitening agents are higher and safely applied by
                            trained staff. This allows for faster, more noticeable results with minimized risk.
                            Moreover, your dentist will assess your oral health to determine whether whitening is
                            appropriate or if another cosmetic solution is better suited.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="split-section">
                    <div class="text-content">
                        <h2>Teeth Whitening: More Than Just Vanity</h2>
                        <p>A brighter smile often goes beyond appearance. Studies show that people with whiter teeth are
                            perceived as more approachable and confident. It can influence personal and professional
                            interactions, making it a meaningful investment for many.</p>
                        <p>However, it's important to manage expectations. Whitening doesn’t change the natural color
                            of your teeth but can remove years of staining. Also, restorations like crowns and fillings
                            won't respond to whitening agents.</p>
                        <h2>Risks and Counterpoints</h2>
                        <p>Like any treatment, teeth whitening isn’t risk-free. The most common side effects include
                            temporary tooth sensitivity and gum irritation. These symptoms usually subside within a few
                            days.</p>
                        <p>That said, unsupervised use of bleaching agents can cause more severe damage, including
                            enamel erosion or uneven whitening. That’s why professional oversight is not just
                            recommended but essential.</p>

                        <h2>Perspectives to Consider</h2>
                        <p>Some people assume whitening is purely cosmetic, but it often plays a role in broader oral
                            care goals. For instance, a person who has invested in whitening is more likely to adopt
                            better hygiene habits to maintain their new smile.</p>
                        <p>Others may worry about the cost. But when you factor in the risks of DIY
                            methods—including irreversible enamel loss or increased dental sensitivity—professional
                            treatment is the smarter long-term choice.</p>
