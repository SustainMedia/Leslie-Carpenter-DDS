                    <p class="lead text-center">Have you ever experienced jaw pain, headaches, or a clicking sound when
                        you chew or talk? These seemingly minor symptoms may point to a bigger issue involving your
                        temporomandibular joint (TMJ). This small joint acts as a hinge connecting your jawbone to your
                        skull, and when it's not functioning properly, it can disrupt your daily life in unexpected
                        ways.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">If you've wondered, "What is a TMJ evaluation and why might I need
                        one?"—you're not alone. Many individuals endure symptoms for months or even years before seeking
                        professional help. This guide aims to demystify the TMJ evaluation process and highlight how
                        timely intervention can make a significant difference.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A TMJ evaluation is a specialized assessment of the jaw joint and surrounding muscles.</li>
                        <li>It helps identify disorders causing pain, stiffness, or misalignment.</li>
                        <li>Early diagnosis can prevent chronic issues and offer effective treatment options.</li>
                        <li>TMJ disorders often mimic other conditions, making professional assessment crucial.</li>

                        <h2>What Happens During a TMJ Evaluation?</h2>
                        <p>A TMJ evaluation typically begins with a detailed medical and dental history. Your provider
                            will ask about symptoms such as pain, clicking, or difficulty moving the jaw. Next comes a
                            physical exam, which includes palpating the jaw muscles, checking the range of motion, and
                            listening for joint noises.</p>
                        <p>Advanced diagnostics like panoramic X-rays or 3D imaging may also be used to view the joint
                            structure. Some clinics may use bite analysis tools to study how your teeth align and
                            function, ensuring a comprehensive diagnosis.</p>

                        <h2>Common Signs You May Need an Evaluation</h2>
                        <p>You might wonder whether your symptoms are serious enough for a professional evaluation. Common
                            signs that should not be ignored include persistent jaw pain or soreness, headaches centered
                            around the temples, clicking or popping noises when moving your jaw, a limited ability to
                            open or close your mouth, or a feeling that your jaw is out of alignment.</p>
                        <p>These issues may start off mild but can worsen if left untreated. That's why understanding
                            what a TMJ evaluation is can help you act sooner rather than later.</p>

                        <h2>Treatment Options and the Risks of Delay</h2>
                        <p>Once a TMJ disorder is diagnosed, treatment will depend on the cause and severity.
                            Non-invasive treatments include custom night guards, physical therapy, or lifestyle
                            adjustments. In some cases, medications may be prescribed. For more severe conditions,
                            dental correction or surgical intervention may be necessary, but this is a last resort.</p>
                        <p>Ignoring TMJ symptoms may lead to chronic pain, migraines, or permanent jaw damage. The
                            longer a disorder goes untreated, the more complex the treatment can become. Early
                            evaluation offers the best chance for managing symptoms effectively.</p>
