                                <p class="mb-6">A child’s first dental visit should happen by their first birthday or within six months of their first tooth erupting—whichever comes first. Early visits help detect potential problems, establish healthy routines, and create positive associations with oral care. Delayed appointments increase the risk of early childhood cavities, gum issues, and even developmental complications. While many parents believe brushing at home is sufficient, professional assessment remains crucial. By understanding the right timing and purpose of this first visit, you can safeguard your child’s smile from the very beginning.</p>

                                <p class="mb-4">Pediatric dental associations widely recommend that a child should have their first dental visit by age one. Alternatively, the visit should happen within six months after their first tooth appears—often around 6 to 10 months old.</p>
                                <p class="mb-6">Why so early? Cavities can develop as soon as teeth erupt. Baby teeth may be temporary, but they’re essential for chewing, speech, jaw development, and guiding adult teeth into position. Ignoring these early indicators can cause problems that extend beyond the mouth.</p>
                                <p class="mb-6">In fact, studies show that children who visit a dentist by age one are less likely to need restorative procedures in the future. That means fewer fillings, fewer extractions, and far fewer tears.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Tooth Decay:</strong> Baby bottle tooth decay is surprisingly common. Sugars from milk, juice, or snacks can erode enamel faster than you might think.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Developmental Issues:</strong> Dental misalignment or jaw concerns are best caught early. The longer they’re missed, the harder they are to fix.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Preventive care is far more affordable than treatment. A first visit can help avoid costly repairs down the road.</li>
