                    <ul>
                        <li>A primary policyholder (age 18+) can add a spouse or domestic partner.</li>
                        <li>Dependent children typically qualify up to age 19; many plans extend eligibility up to age
                            26 for students or dependents with disabilities.</li>
                        <li>Coverage usually includes preventive care (cleanings, exams) and further procedures
                            (fillings, crowns) depending on plan level.</li>
                        <li>State rules and specific plan terms affect how long a dependent stays covered.</li>
                        <li>Clarify limits and waiting periods before choosing a plan.</li>

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>A family dental policy generally covers the main adult subscriber, their spouse or partner,
                            and dependent children—often up to age 26 depending on student or disability status.
                            Coverage includes routine care and basic dental services, though benefits and age limits
                            vary by plan and jurisdiction.</p>

                        <h2>Who Can Be on a Family Dental Plan?</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Primary Policyholder:</strong> The policy begins with the main subscriber, who is typically an adult aged 18 or older. This person is responsible for payments and handles plan changes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Spouse or Domestic Partner:</strong> Most plans let the primary insured add a spouse or legally recognized partner.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dependent Children:</strong> Children are normally eligible up to age 19. Many insurers, following broader health coverage norms, allow full-time students or dependents with verified disabilities to remain covered until age 22–26.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A family with two high school children can include both under the plan until each turns 19. If one child goes to college and remains unmarried, they often stay covered until age 24, depending on state and plan policy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Extended Rules:</strong> Certain federal or military-affiliated programs allow extended dependent eligibility—sometimes until age 23 for students. Requirements vary: some plans require the dependent to be unmarried, enrolled in school, or financially reliant on the policyholder.</p>

                        <h2>What’s Covered on a Typical Family Dental Plan?</h2>
                        <p><strong>Preventive Services:</strong> Most plans cover preventive care at 100%, including routine teeth cleanings, exams, and X‑rays. These services help catch issues early and cost little to no out-of-pocket expense.</p>
                        <p><strong>Basic and Major Procedures:</strong> Coverage extends to fillings, tooth extractions, and sometimes crowns or root canals. The percentage covered depends on the plan. Some restrict major procedures until after a waiting period (often 6–12 months).</p>
                        <p><strong>Orthodontics and Cosmetic Add-Ons:</strong> Orthodontic treatments (braces) may be included in higher-tier plans or offered as an optional benefit. Cosmetic procedures (like teeth whitening) are rarely covered.</p>

                        <h2>Implications and Broader Considerations</h2>
                        <p><strong>Financial Planning:</strong> Having a family plan often lowers total costs: consolidated premiums, shared deductible, and coverage for multiple members. For full-time students or adult children, staying on a family plan can save significantly compared to buying separate insurance.</p>
                        <p><strong>Planning for Lifecycle Changes:</strong> Major life events may change eligibility: marriage, job-based coverage, adoption, or a child turning 19. Most plans have special enrollment windows for life events like these.</p>
                        <p><strong>State-Specific Differences:</strong> Some states mandate extended age limits for dependents. Always verify local regulations—coverage length for adult children varies by jurisdiction.</p>

                        <h2>Perspectives and Common Confusions</h2>
                        <p><strong>Counterpoints:</strong> Not all insurers extend coverage through age 26—even for students. Plans may cut off at age 21. Some policies exclude unmarried partners or require proof of dependency. Waiting periods can limit access to major care early in coverage.</p>
                        <p><strong>Decision Tips:</strong> Ask these questions when comparing plans:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How long can each member stay on the plan?</li>
                            <li>What’s the waiting period before major procedures?</li>
                            <li>Are preventive services fully covered?</li>
                            <li>Do you need to select in-network dentists for full benefits?</li>
                        </ul>

                                <p>A: Yes. Many plans offer extended dependent coverage until age 26 if the adult child

                    <p>Understanding who can be on a dental plan and what services are included helps you make smart
                        decisions about your family's oral health. Coverage for spouses, children, and—often—adult
                        dependents under age 26 offers flexibility. Most policies cover preventive care, with more
                        extensive procedures available after waiting periods. State laws and plan-specific terms matter
                        a great deal.</p>
                    <p>Thinking ahead, consider your family's needs and life changes, and choose a plan that grows with
                        you.</p>
