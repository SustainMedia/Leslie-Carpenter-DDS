                    <p class="text-center">Understanding the lifespan of dentures isn't just about numbers—it's about
                        quality of life. From chewing to speaking, the durability of full dentures can affect everything
                        from your social confidence to your nutritional well-being. In this blog, we’ll break down what
                        affects denture longevity, expert insights, and how to make informed decisions that support

                    <ul>
                        <li>Most full dentures last between 5 to 10 years, depending on care and changes in your oral
                            structure.</li>
                        <li>Lifestyle habits, bone resorption, and materials used can all impact denture longevity.</li>
                        <li>Routine dental visits are critical to maintaining denture performance and fit.</li>
                        <li>DIY fixes may seem tempting but often cause more harm than good.</li>

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Dentures typically last between five to ten years, but this range is influenced by several
                            key factors such as material quality, daily hygiene, and changes in jawbone structure. Even
                            if dentures appear intact, underlying issues like poor fit or shifting bite alignment can
                            lead to discomfort or oral health problems over time.</p>
                        <p>Experts recommend periodic adjustments and routine exams to extend your denture’s lifespan.
                            Regular visits to your dental provider can prevent common issues and support both comfort
                            and function.</p>

                        <h2>What Are Full Dentures, and Why Does Longevity Matter?</h2>
                        <p>Full dentures are removable prosthetic devices that replace all teeth in the upper or lower
                            arch. While they restore appearance and basic function, they are not a permanent solution.
                            They’re susceptible to natural wear and physiological changes in your mouth—especially bone
                            loss, which alters their fit.</p>
                        <p>The question "how long do complete dentures last" matters because an ill-fitting denture
                            isn’t just uncomfortable—it can affect your bite, cause gum irritation, and even impact
                            facial structure. Denture longevity goes hand-in-hand with your overall oral health.</p>

                            lead to poor alignment, discomfort, and even infection. Worse, they might damage the denture

                        <h2>What Do Experts Say About Replacement Timelines?</h2>
                        <p>Most dental experts agree that full dentures should be replaced every 7 to 10 years, although
                            some may last longer with excellent care. However, signs of wear, looseness, or discomfort
                            often appear earlier.</p>
                        <p><em>Study Insight: The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry has indicated that denture wearers
                                often begin to experience noticeable changes in fit and function around year
                                five—highlighting the need for routine professional evaluation.</em></p>
                        <p>If you’ve had your dentures for over five years, now is the time to ask: are they still
                            serving you well?</p>

                        <p>For some patients, long-term stability may come from transitioning to implant-supported dentures. These are more secure and help reduce bone loss but come with higher costs and surgical procedures. Full dentures remain a widely accessible and effective solution, but regular updates and care are essential to ensure they continue working well for your lifestyle.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Full dentures restore more than just your smile—they bring back your ability to eat, speak, and
                        engage confidently. But they don’t last forever. From daily wear to changes in your bone
                        structure, several factors influence their durability.</p>
                    <p>So, how long do complete dentures last? The answer isn’t just measured in years—but in the
                        quality of care you provide and the professionals you trust.</p>
